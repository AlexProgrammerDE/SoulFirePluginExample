# SoulFirePluginExample

Example of how to make a plugin for SoulFire.

This example adds a hack jump boost to SoulFire, which by default gives the bot jump boost with the amplifier 2.
The amplifier and the plugin can be configured in the plugins menu under `Hack Jump Boost` and CLI flags are also registered.

Official SoulFire Javadocs are hosted on [CodeMC CI](https://ci.codemc.io/job/AlexProgrammerDE/job/SoulFire/javadoc/index.html).

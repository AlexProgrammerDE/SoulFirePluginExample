# SoulFirePluginExample

Example of how to make a plugin for SoulFire.

This example adds a hack jump boost to ServerWrecker, which by default gives the bot jump boost with the amplifier 2.
The amplifier and the plugin can be configured in the plugins menu under `Hack Jump Boost` and CLI flags are also registered.
